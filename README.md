# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Website

An amazing list of movie trailers for your viewing pleasure! :)

## Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites
* A machine with an internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE, etc.)
* Python v2.x.x or later installed on said machine
* A little Github know-how, unless you use the Cloud9 link below (at least the ability to clone/download a repo)

#### Downloading and Generating the HTML File

1. Use `git clone` to clone the repo, or if you're not yet a Git aficionado,
the **Clone or Download** button is your friend!

2. Open up the terminal and change the current
directory using `cd PATH_OF_DIRECTORY`, where `PATH_OF_DIRECTORY` is the 
full path to the folder containing the movie trailer files.

3. Run `python entertainment_center.py` to generate and open the 
`fresh_tomatoes.html` file.
