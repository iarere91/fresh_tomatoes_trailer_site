# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Website

An amazing list of movie trailers for your viewing pleasure! :)

## Quickstart Guide

#### Downloading and Generating the HTML File

1. Use `git clone` to clone the repo, or if you're not yet a Git aficionado,
the **Clone or Download** button is your friend!

2. Open up the terminal and change the current
directory using `cd PATH_OF_DIRECTORY`, where `PATH_OF_DIRECTORY` is the 
movie trailer repository that you just cloned/downloaded.

3. Run `python entertainment_center.py` to generate and open the 
`fresh_tomatoes.html` file.
